Updater is an application updater, it will update and upgrade your deployed applications to the latest release running any tasks before and after each update that are specific to each each release.

This is for developers who have created an application that people install, and want them to be able to update the application easily from either a public or private repository.

It works with [composer](https://getcomposer.org/) repositories such as [packagist.org](https://packagist.org/) or static repositories generated by [satis](https://getcomposer.org/doc/articles/handling-private-packages.md).

```
$ updater update

- Checking for updates company/app (1.0.2)
- Downloading company/app (1.0.3)
- Running before scripts:
 > bin/console backup
- Extracting company/app (1.0.3)
- Running after scripts:
 > composer update
 > bin/console db:migrate
```

## Installation

Download the source and build `updater` application.

```bash
$ git clone http://github.com/jamielsharief/updater updater
```

Now build the PHAR, this will create `bin/updater.phar`, you can copy this into your application `bin` folder.

```bash
$ cd updater
$ php -d phar.readonly=Off bin/build
```

To install globally:

```bash
$ cp bin/updater.phar /usr/local/bin/updater
```

## Usage

Create `updater.json` in your application project folder, and in each release you can configure it to run `before` and `after` commands, bash or PHP scripts - if and when needed.

```json
{
    "url": "https://packagist.org",
    "package": "company/app",
    "scripts": {
        "before": [
            "bin/console db:backup"
        ],
        "after": [
            "bin/console db:migrate"
        ]
    }
}
```

If you are using a private [satis repository](https://getcomposer.org/doc/articles/handling-private-packages.md), change the `url` in the `updater.json` , e.g. `https://www.example.com` and setup authentication for `composer`, if required.


### Authentication

Currently only `http-basic` authorization is supported, to work with this simply create the `auth.json` in your project directory. However you can also generate a satis private repository which can then connect to various repositories and supports more authentication methods.

```json
{
    "http-basic": {
        "example.com": {
            "username": "token",
            "password": "878ec3cebea5b2c1ee4c0becdb00d3d3"
        },
    }
}
```

> Composer can create this for you as well `composer config http-basic.example.com username password --global`


### Initializing the Project

To get started with `updater` you need to initialize the project.

Run the `updater init` command to initialize the updater, you will be prompted for the current version, and updates after this will be pulled.

```bash
$ updater init
```

### Updating

To update your application just run the following command, which will run all updates that are available in sequence.


```bash
$ updater update
```

If you want to run all available updates in the current major release

```bash
$ updater update --all
```

> You can use the `--verbose` option to see the output of the scripts, if any

You can test using the `dev-master` or `dev-main` branch and the lock file will not be adjusted. You can run this as many times as you need.

```bash
$ updater update --dev
```

### Upgrading

> This will only upgrade to the next major version if there are no pending updates, and it will not update any versions after the first next major version.

To upgrade to the next major release run the `upgrade` command.

```bash
$ updater upgrade
```

> You can use the `--verbose` option to see the output of the scripts, if any

You can test using the `dev-master` or `dev-main` branch and the lock file will not be adjusted. You can run this as many times as you need.

```bash
$ updater upgrade --dev
```

## Demonstration

> This demo assumes you have downloaded the source of `updater` and you are going to download the source of `updater-demo` and place this in the demo subfolder.

First download the source for the `updater` and run `composer install`, then download the `updater-demo` into the `demo` directory.

```bash
$ composer create-project jamielsharief/updater-demo:0.1.0 demo
```

Create `updater.json` in `demo` folder, set the URL to the repository.

```json
{
    "url": "https://packagist.org",
    "package": "jamielsharief/updater-demo",
    "scripts": {
        "before": [],
        "after": []
    }
}
```

Initialize `updater`, mentioning the directory where you extracted the zip archive too.

```bash
$ bin/updater init demo --version 0.1.0
```

Then run the `update` command to get the next available update

```bash
$ bin/updater update demo
```

You can also run the upgrade as well 

```bash
$ bin/updater upgrade demo
```

## Development/Testing

To setup for testing you need have [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) installed. When you build the container it will create a small web sever with the satis repository.

```bash
$ cd tests/TestServer
$ docker build -t satis-dev .
```

Anytime you want to fire up the Docker container, which will make `http://localhost:8000` available.

```bash
$ docker run -d -p 8000:80 satis-dev
```

If you goto `http://localhost:8000` you should see a repository page.


Fetch the development dependencies

```bash
$ composer update --dev
```

To run the `PHPUnit` tests

```bash
$ vendor/bin/phpunit
```
